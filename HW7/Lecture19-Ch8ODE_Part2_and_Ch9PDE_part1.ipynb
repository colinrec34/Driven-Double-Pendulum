    "## Lecture19 - Ch. 8: ODE, part 2  and Ch. 9: Partial Differential Equations\n",
    "In the first part of this notebook we will explore adaptive step-size algoritms for solving ordinary differential equations. Then we will look at Boundary Value problems and Eigenvalue problems. In the previous notebook, we were learning about initial value problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part we will explore Ch. 9 Partial Differential Equations. The techniques there, in particular the relaxation method can be used just as well for ordinary equations (or for systems of linear equations as well, even if they are not differential equations).\n",

    "## 8.4 Varying the step size\n",
    "All the methods we have looked at used a fixed value, h, for the step size. We could choose that. If we wanted better accuracy we could rerun the code with a smaller step size. This may work fine in many cases, especially if there are not rapid variations in the actual solution we are looking for. There is a danger in this approach, however. There is an error associated with each step and these errors add up. If one step (or a few) have larger errors, this may have a large affect the reliability of our solution after that point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider Figure 8.6 in the textbook. Look at an evaluation point (vertical line) just before the peak (5th or 6th vertical line). What if we extrapolated using the slope at that point to compute x(t+h) the value of the next point (Euler method). The error is the difference between our estimate and the true value of the solution. For a large step size this is huge if the function suddenly changes rapidly. For a small step size our estimate will be able to capture the large drop in the function. The lesson, if we use too large step sizes we might miss important, small scale features and our solution will be unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an approach to adjust the step size as we go. The goal will be to estimate the uncertainty of every step (or two steps) and make sure it is less than a required value. If it is too big we reduce the step size, h, and redo that step. If it is below our target accuracy, we continue to the next step but increase the step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two steps in an adaptive step size method are:\n",
    "1. estimate the error on the current step(s).\n",
    "2. compare to our chosen accuracy per step and increase or decrease the step size depending on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically it is best to choose a small initial step, h. First, we can do two steps using a Runge-Kutta method and compute x(t+h) and x(t+2h). Second, we compute x(t+2h) using a Runge-Kutta method in one step of width 2h. For a $4^{th}$-order Runge-Kutta method, the error is proportional to $c h^{5}$ were c is some constant.

    "2. From same starting point, perform one step of size 2h using your solution method to get estimate $x_{2}(t+2h)$.\n",
    "3. Use these two estimates of $x(t+2h)$ to compute the ratio $\\rho$.\n",
    "4. (a) If $\\rho > 1$ the actual accuracy of our Runge-Kutta method is better than the target accuracy. Increase the step size (reduce computation time, and accuracy a little) while proceeding to the next step in our solution.\n",
    "   (b) If $\\rho < 1$ the actual accuracy of our Runge-Kutta method is worse than the target accuracy. Decrease the step size and redo this step, before moving on. If needed keep reducing the step size until the desired accuracy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "Always use the solution $x_{1}$ which was obtained using smaller step size h. It will give a more accurate solution than $x_{2}$ which was only used to estimate the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the adaptive step size method requires more calculations, it also converges to a solution that has the required accuracy much more quickly. In the end it takes less time, and usually a lot less!\n",
    "\n",
    "In case $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ accidentally give the same value and $\\rho = \\infty$. Limit how much h can increase each time it is adjusted and this can be avoided. Maybe require that it can not increase more than a factor of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adaptive step size method can be extended to systems of differential equations. Just repeat the procedure to compute $\\epsilon_{x}$ and $\\epsilon_{y}$ if there are two variables, for example. The process for extending to systems of differential equations, and a few other details, are described on page 359-361.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.5 Other solution methods (revisited)\n",
    "I just want to point out the Bulirsch-Stoer Method. For relatively smooth functions (that lack pathologies like divergences, rapid fluctuations, etc.) this method is often even better than an adaptive step size Runge-Kutta method.  It is a bit more complicated to code, but there is an example provide in Example 8.7. (Or, perhaps there is a package that you may import it from.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.6 Boundary Value Problems\n",
    "So far we have looked at *initial value problems*. We are given a differential equation and an initial value of each dependent variable at some time, $t_{0}$. We also will encounter *boundary value problems* which are typically harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a ball thrown in the air. It's motion is described by $a=-g$ which is a differntial equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} = -g\n",
    "$$\n",
    "To solve this second-order differential equation, we two initial values for position $x_{0}$ and velocity $v_{0}$. That is an *initial value problem*. Alternatively, we could be given an initial position $x_{t=0}$ and a final position $x{t_{final}}$ at the boundaries (endpoints) and find a solution that satisfies those. (In this case, as part of the solution process, we would need to determine an initial velocity that gives a solution that matches these boundaries.) We can use combinations of techniques we already know to solve this type of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The shooting method\n",
    "This is a fundamental technique. We use trial-and-error to *search for* initial conditions that satisfy the boundary conditions. This would involve searching for an initial velocity in the case of a ball thrown in the air so that it hits the target (end point) that was specified. This reduces the problem to an initial value problem again.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, for a ball tossed in the air, we can simply guess a starting value for the upward velocity, solve the differential equations and check if the solution satisfies the boundary condition. (Does the ball hit the end target position? If the boundary condition is not met, change the initial velocity and solve again. Repeat until you have the correct initial value and the corresponding correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, there is some function $x_{final}=f(v)$ that gives the height of the ball, $x_{final}=0$, at time $t_{final}$ as a function of initial vertical velocity, v. We need to find the initial velocity that gives $x_{final}=0$. In otherwords, we need the roots of this equation. You can use binary search, or any method from Ch. 6, to find the root (the initial velocity in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good example of combining different numerical techniques to achieve our goal. In this case, we combine one method for solving Ordinary Differential Equations ($4^{th}$-order Runge-Kutta) to compute $x=f(v)$ with one root finding method (binary search, etc.) to find the correct value of v so that x matches our boundary condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cell, find the code from Example 8.8. The ball is thrown in the air from $x_{0}=0$ at $t_{0}=0$ and lands again at $x=04$ at $t_{final}=10$ seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can replace\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} = -g\n",
    "$$\n",
    "by a system of first-order equations\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dx}{dt} = y, \\qquad \\qquad \\frac{dy}{dt} = -g.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(y is velocity here.) These are solved using a $4^{th}$-order Runge-Kutta method and a binary search method to find the initial velocity."

    "We could solve for a three dimensional box almost just as easily. Consider what changes in the code would be needed to solve a three dimensional box. How many for loops? Would the run time be affected? (Consider it already takes 10 minutes to run the 2D case with only 101x101 grid points.)\n",
    "### ANSWER: Making this a 3D problem would turn the solution space into a cube of pixels, which could be accomplished with an additional nested for loop. This would significantly increase the runtime; Since the number of iterations would increase from $M^2$ to $M^3$. If it takes 10 minutes for the 2D code, it would increase to about 30 minutes of runtime with the additional for loop.\n",

    "The Jacobi method is a great starting point but it does have some drawbacks to consider. It is rather slow for one. There are modifications that can greatly speed it up, as we will see. Second, it gives rather approximate solutions because it relies upon finite difference approximations of $2^{nd}$ derivatives. These are derivatives of the first derivatives which are also approximations. (So we are computing approximate values using other approximate values.) One can use higher-order derivative approximations (Section 5.10.4) or increase the number of grid points. But as we just observed, this will slow down the calculation even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another complication occurs if the shape we encounter is not a simple shape. If it is oddly shaped, it is more difficult to construct a grid of points. One might just assign the boundary conditions to the closest grid point to the boundary, but that introduces some additional error. Techniques exist, such as varying the grid spacing (perhaps adaptive grid spacing), to minimize such errors. \n",

    "Each step of the relaxation method presumably brings the estimated solution at each step closer to the true solution. Why not help it out? Why not move the solution a little further each time by a small factor. This might not work each time we might overshoot sometimes but then the solution will move back on the next iteration, hopefully. To clarify this, in our relaxation method each time we compute a new estimate of the solution at each grid point (x,y), we are adding a small amount $\\Delta \\phi(x,y)$ to the previous value:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\phi^{'}(x,y) = \\phi(x,y) + \\Delta \\phi(x,y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Instead of adding $\\Delta \\phi(x,y)$, let's add a little bit more $(1+\\omega)\\Delta \\phi(x,y)$, where $\\omega$ is a positive number (and will probably be less than one):\n",

    "\\phi_{\\omega}(x,y) = \\phi(x,y) + (1+\\omega) \\phi(x,y)\n",

    "We choose $\\omega$. This leads to the new equation we must compute for each grid point (each time through the while loop in the example):\n",

    "$$\n",
    "The problem with this modification alone is *numerically unstable*, though we will shortly see it can be made stable in combination with another modification. The solutions may diverge when overrelaxation is applied on its own. But if it works it would reduce the time for computation significantly.\n",
    "### Gauss-Seidel Method\n",
    "not much faster, but half the memory used\n",
    "Recall in the Jacobi method, for each grid point, we are computing the average value of four surrounding points at (x+a,y), (x-a,y), (x,y+a), and (x,y-a). We assign these to the solutions $\\phi$ at (x,y). We have been computing these averages using the old value. But when we get to point (x,y), we have already computed new values at (x-a,y) and (x,y-a) which are presumably better! Why use the old, less accurate values? There is no reason. Just use th new values for any surrounding points that are available. The result is we converge to our solution a bit faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "The increase in speed by doing this is not that dramatic. However, we can use a single array of grid points rather than two. We just overwrite the old values with the new ones for each point. This reduces the memory required by a factor of two! Important if we have an extremely large grid, as we may.\n",

    "Stable, much faster, AND half the memory!\n",

    "\\phi_{\\omega}(x,y) \\leftarrow \\frac{1+\\omega^{'}}{4} \\left[ \\phi(x+a,y) + \\phi(x-a,y) + \\phi(x,y+a) + \\phi(x,y-a) \\right] - \\omega \\phi(x,y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The three advantages of this approach are\n",
    "1. The method is stable, it will converge to a solution,\n",
    "2. It is faster than using Jacobi method with only overrelaxation or only Gauss-Seidel,\n",
    "3. It uses half the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an win, win, win. In otherwords, this is probably the approach you want, maybe even in fairly simple cases! \n",
    "\n",
    "The text desribes how to choose the optimal value of $\\omega$ for the overrelaxation method or combined method. Basically, you want to choose $\\omega<1$ to get a stable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook author found this approach reduced the run time for Example 9.1 code from 10 minutes (with an $MxM=100x100$ grid) to 38 seconds. That is a pretty good improvement!"
